# Android-Testing-With-Appium

I have developed a testing platform for Android with Appium and Selenium.
Here I have tried to create a user on Whatsapp and Instagram. Only OTP is sent to the user.

One problem is that my pc is not so fast. So in the demonstration, there is some delay.
Another thing, after clicking a button the DOM needs to be refreshed and then due to not loading yet, I needed to do some thread sleep. But there is another elegant way to handle that. I am giving the link here: https://link.sumon.com.bd/wait-appium

Happy Coding :)
